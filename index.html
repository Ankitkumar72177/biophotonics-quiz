                         explanation: "The required laser power depends on the treatment area, photosensitizer concentration, and desired light dose (fluence rate x time). Power levels in the range of hundreds of mW to a few Watts are often used, aiming for specific fluence rates (e.g., 50-200 mW/cm²). 1-2W could be typical for some applications."

                         correctAnswer: "Highly monochromatic",
                         explanation: "Lasers provide highly monochromatic (single wavelength) light that can be precisely matched to the absorption peak of the photosensitizer, maximizing its activation efficiency. They also offer high power density and can be delivered via optical fibers. Refer lecture 38."

                         explanation: "To be effective, the light source's wavelength must overlap significantly with an absorption peak of the photosensitizer to efficiently excite it and initiate the photochemical reactions leading to cell death."
